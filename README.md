# Final-Project
This is my final project for my introduction to programming and problem solving in python course. This project took approximately two weeks to colmplete.
It was a lot of fun and I learned about web design, internet servers, and digital marketing within the realm of this project. 

The purpose of this project was to practice applicating my computer science skills to build a website from scratch using html, css, and java to accomplish this. The 
editior I used was the digital studio platform and the webserver my website is hosted on is the wget https://cdn.cs50.net/2019/fall/tracks/web/homepage/homepage.zip 
located ikn that zipfile from the harvard website page. 

I was able to create a website for my dad's skateboard reburbishing and collecting business where he typically uses Facebook Marketplace to accomplish this.
The website has a homepage, buy now, gallery, contact all of which includes images, links, and naviagtion around the site. The overall aesthectic is very basic
but the user features do work and the layout does makesense making the site useable. All in all I am really proud of the project and hope my dad likes it.
