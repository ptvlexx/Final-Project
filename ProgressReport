I AM CHANGING MY PROJECT EMAILING SECTION LEADER TONIGHT/TOMORROW WITH UPDATES

The new direction I am taking with the project is to simply focus on building a solid website that has 10 html 10 tags, at least 4 html pages that are linked to one another, and integrate some feautres from Bootstrap to assit with creating an appealing aesthetic for the site. 

Overall, I am changing the website focus from data analytics to making a website for my dads skateboard business just to help him display his work for customers to see.

#### What have you done for your project so far?
So far I have gone through the harvard module that was shared on the class canvas page. I followed along with the course and used their server to begin buidling the index of the website. As of tonight I have began adding additional pages to my site that are linked in the site index. I am adding information like pictures, titles, and descriptions to each page I add.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?
I have not made the seperate pages of my website reachablle from any page on the website. I still need a home button and a better theme for the site. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?
So far I have only encountered a few obstacles when it came to first accessing the server to build my website on from the harvard course, but I was able to work pass this and begin building the website. Another problem I had was the topic I wanted to do after I was told to make a website by Prof. Rosen for my project when I said I wanted to do data analysis haha. So I was no longger interested in my inital idea afer the zoom propsal with him that I also put in github for the propsal portion. But I think making a website for my dad will be fun and feel really rewarding in the end.
